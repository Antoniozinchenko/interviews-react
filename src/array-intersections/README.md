#### Task
User is going to report working hours, but doesn't know when will be day offs and vacations.
So our goal is to fix parseData method and return reporting data excluded vacations.
#### Assumptions
 - data and vacations arrays are already sorted and valid (don't have duplications or intersected elements inside)
 - vacaion start and end days can be included inside result
